## Files
src/**/*.test.tsx
src/**/*.test.ts

## Rules
- Use Vitest as the test runner and React Testing Library (RTL) for rendering and interacting with components.
- Co-locate test files with the source files (e.g., `Button.tsx` and `Button.test.tsx`).
- Focus on testing component behavior from the user's perspective. Query elements by accessible roles, text, or test IDs.
- Avoid testing implementation details.
- Use `render` from RTL to render components.
- Use `userEvent` from RTL for simulating user interactions.
- Use `screen` queries from RTL.
- Mock external dependencies (API calls, modules) using Vitest's mocking capabilities (`vi.fn`, `vi.mock`).
- Write tests for different prop combinations and edge cases.
- Ensure tests clean up properly after each run.
