- Keep functions small and focused.
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions and hooks.
- Ensure all generated code passes ESLint checks based on `@file(react-template-ai/eslint.config.js)`.
- Adhere to the project structure defined in `@file(.cursor/rules/2-structure.md)`.
- Use American English for all comments and documentation.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability.
