## Files
ai/docs/**/*.md
src/**/*.ts
src/**/*.tsx

## Rules
- Document new features in the `ai/docs/` directory, following the structure of `@file(react-template-ai/ai/docs/example-feature.md)`.
- Include sections for Overview, Implementation Details (Data Model, API, Components, Hooks, State), User Flows, and Usage Examples.
- Add JSDoc comments to exported functions, hooks, and complex types to explain their purpose, parameters, and return values.
- Keep documentation concise and up-to-date with the code.
- Reference relevant PRD sections (`@file(react-template-ai/ai/prd.md)`) or Plan phases (`@file(react-template-ai/ai/plan.md)`) in feature documentation.
