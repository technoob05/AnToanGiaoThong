## Overview

This template is specifically engineered to optimize the developer experience when working with AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or similar tools. It provides a structured, feature-based architecture with clear conventions that AI tools can understand and follow consistently, leveraging the latest features of React 19 and Tailwind CSS v4.

## Features

- **AI-Optimized Structure**: Clear organization patterns that AI tools can consistently follow (see `.cursor/rules/`)
- **Feature-Based Architecture**: Self-contained feature modules for intuitive code organization
- **Scalable Patterns**: Well-documented patterns for React 19 hooks, components, and state management
- **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling with TypeScript, ESLint 9 (flat config), Vite, and structured testing
- **Comprehensive Guidelines**: Detailed rules in `.cursor/rules/` and `ai/` directory serve as documentation for both developers and AI
- **Phased Implementation Plan**: Clear roadmap for implementing features in a structured way

## Getting Started

```

## Key Architectural Patterns

- **Feature-Based Organization**: Features are encapsulated in self-contained modules.
- **Component Composition**: Build complex UIs with composable, focused components using Shadcn UI and Tailwind v4.
- **Custom Hooks & React 19**: Extract business logic into reusable hooks, leveraging React 19 features like the use hook where appropriate.
- **Tiered State Management**: Clear guidelines for local, feature (Context API), and potentially global state (e.g., Zustand).

## Development with AI

### AI Workflow

1. **Plan First**: Begin with a clear plan (see ai/plan.md).
2. **Use Structure**: Follow the feature-based organization for new code.
3. **Reference Guidelines**: AI should reference `.cursor/rules/` for project conventions and patterns.
4. **Document As You Go**: Add documentation for completed features in `ai/docs/` following the example.

### Effective AI Prompts

When working with AI coding assistants, provide context by referencing the rules directory:

- "Following the project structure in `.cursor/rules/2-structure.md` and React patterns in `.cursor/rules/3-react-patterns.md`, create a new feature called [name] that..."
- "Based on the styling patterns in `.cursor/rules/4-styling-patterns.md`, style the [ComponentName] using Tailwind CSS v4 utilities. Use `size-*` instead of `w-*` and `h-*`."
- "Create a hook `useAsyncData` that uses the React 19 `use` hook to read the promise state, following the patterns in `.cursor/rules/3-react-patterns.md`."
- "Create tests for this component following the testing patterns in `.cursor/rules/5-testing-patterns.md`."

## Tech Stack
